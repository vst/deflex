*deflex* is et another *Differential Evolution* package...

There are 3 (and a half) Differential Evolution (DE) packages on CRAN
as of the moment this package has been initiated. This package,
however, is designed to provide functional control over the evolution
process bringing greater flexibility for experimenting with documented
and custom DE strategies.
